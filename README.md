- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrei or @frontman404. I'm a student in Romania, last year, soon to be getting my bachelor degree in electrical engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in fun, useful projects, only python3 at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning phyton3 and java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if it sparks my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me... I don't think anyone wants to reach me.
