- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrei or @frontman404. I'm an engineer in Romania, last year, soon to be getting my bachelor degree in electrical engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning phyton3 and java, developing cute little programs in my free time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if it sparks my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me... I don't think anyone wants to reach me.
